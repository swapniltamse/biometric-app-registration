# AI Model Selection Guidance for Facial Biometric Authentication

## Model Comparison for Facial Recognition

| Model | Accuracy | Speed | Size | Best Use Case |
|-------|----------|-------|------|---------------|
| SSD MobileNet v1 | High | Medium | ~30MB | Registration / High-security verification |
| TinyFace Detector | Medium | Fast | ~2MB | Login verification / Low-resource devices |
| MTCNN | Very High | Slow | ~40MB | Advanced verification / Liveness detection |
| BlazeFace | Medium-High | Very Fast | ~5MB | Mobile applications |

## Benefits of Automated Verification

1. **Scalability**: 
   - Handles unlimited concurrent verifications
   - No additional staffing required for growth
   - Consistent performance during peak periods

2. **Consistency**:
   - Identical verification standards for all users
   - Eliminates human bias and fatigue-related errors
   - Creates clear audit trail for compliance purposes

3. **Speed and Efficiency**:
   - Verification in milliseconds vs. minutes/hours for manual review
   - 24/7 availability without staffing concerns
   - Reduced operational costs after initial implementation

4. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Models can be retrained with company-specific data
   - Performance improves over time with more samples
   - Adaptable to changing security requirements

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Threshold Configuration

```javascript
// Conservative (higher security, more false rejections)
const faceMatcher = new faceapi.FaceMatcher(labeledDescriptors, 0.4);

// Balanced (current implementation)
const faceMatcher = new faceapi.FaceMatcher(labeledDescriptors, 0.6);

// Permissive (better UX, slightly lower security)
const faceMatcher = new faceapi.FaceMatcher(labeledDescriptors, 0.7);
```

### 2. Multiple Face Enrollment

Best practice is to capture 3-5 facial samples during enrollment:

```javascript
// Store multiple descriptors for each user
const descriptors = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  // Capture image with slight variation in angle
  const descriptor = await captureAndExtractDescriptor();
  descriptors.push(descriptor);
}

// Create labeled face descriptors with multiple samples
const labeledDescriptors = new faceapi.LabeledFaceDescriptors(
  userId, 
  descriptors
);
```

### 3. Production Deployment Strategy

#### Phase 1: Human-in-loop (Pilot)
- Automated verification with human review of edge cases
- Collect data on false positives/negatives
- Adjust thresholds based on findings

#### Phase 2: Automated with Auditing
- Fully automated verification
- Random auditing of 5-10% of verifications
- Continuous model performance monitoring

#### Phase 3: Advanced Implementation
- Multi-model ensemble approach
- Liveness detection implementation
- Behavioral biometrics addition (typing patterns, mouse movements)

## Security Considerations

1. **Template Storage**:
   - Never store raw images, only encrypted numerical descriptors
   - Use separate encryption keys for biometric data
   - Consider on-device matching where possible

2. **Anti-Spoofing Measures**:
   - Implement randomized challenge-response (smile, blink, turn head)
   - Consider depth-aware cameras for 3D validation
   - Monitor for unusual verification patterns

3. **Privacy Compliance**:
   - Ensure BIPA, GDPR, CCPA compliance
   - Implement data deletion workflows
   - Maintain clear consent management

## Recommended Model Configuration for Our Use Case

Our current implementation using face-api.js with SSD MobileNet for registration and facial verification, combined with ID.me's identity verification, provides an excellent balance of security and usability for insurance advisor authentication.

```javascript
// Current optimal configuration
await faceapi.nets.ssdMobilenetv1.loadFromUri('/models');
await faceapi.nets.faceLandmark68Net.loadFromUri('/models');
await faceapi.nets.faceRecognitionNet.loadFromUri('/models');

const detections = await faceapi.detectAllFaces(
  imageElement, 
  new faceapi.SsdMobilenetv1Options({ minConfidence: 0.5 })
)
.withFaceLandmarks()
.withFaceDescriptors();
```

This multi-layered approach ensures we maintain NIST 800-63-3 IAL2/AAL2 compliance while providing a user-friendly experience for our insurance advisors.
